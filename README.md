# LAMBDASCRIPT
## DOCUMENTATION
LambdaScript is a lambda-oriented language. In fact, there are *no* functions or classes.
There are only anonymous lambdas. Apart from that, it works like you might expect.
```
>> 1 + 2
3
>> 2 ^ 4
16
>> "e" + "i"
'ei'
>> 'alpha' + 'beta' + 'gamma' + 'delta'
'alphabetagammadelta'
>> x = 1
>> x
1
>> x + x
2
>> y = 3
>> y
3
>> y + x
4
```
